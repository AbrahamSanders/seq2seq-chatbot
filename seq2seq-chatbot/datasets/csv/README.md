A generic CSV dataset with two columns - question and answer.

## Instructions:

2) The CSV must have two columns - the first one is for questions and the second one is for answers (responses).

3) Train using the included batch files or the command line. See the [main README](https://github.com/AbrahamSanders/seq2seq-chatbot#training-a-model) for training instructions.
